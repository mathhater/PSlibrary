I upload the code I want to save while doing Problem Solving.
All codes are uploaded in a form that is easy to copy and paste, and are provided in a form that you can immediately know how to use when compiling and executing the code.
For now, only code in C language is uploaded, but other languages may be added later.
It's sloppy performance, so if you don't like the code, use someone else's code.
